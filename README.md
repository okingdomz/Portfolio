## User Story

// Personal ReadMe
```
For this project, I make a UI that displayed simple webpage color coordination with my portfolio. I will have an image of myself, next to the services I wish to provide. I will also have 2-3 projects that i want to be able to handle in the future, and a link to my profile on social media.


The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
